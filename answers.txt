Question 1: How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

Question 2: What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python?

    A server socket needs to be listening at all times in order to receive messages from clients, 
    while a client socket only needs to be open when sending or receiving messages from a server.
    A server socket cat also set the max number of clients it wants to communicate through 
    socket.listen(num_of_connections) before it refuse any incoming connections.

Question 3: How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?

    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

Question 4: What information do we get about incoming connections?

    Address and the data that was sent to the server.

Question 5: What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?
  
    Returns data (in a byte string).

Question 6: Provide a link to your code on GitHub.
